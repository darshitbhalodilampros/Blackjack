## Challenges We Ran Into

1. **Enabling Gaming on Farcaster Frames**: Implementing a nounish gaming experience within Farcaster frames was challenging. We had to develop solutions to allow smooth gameplay within the app, akin to playing games on meta tags.
2. **Managing Database and Frames**: Efficiently managing the game data and frames on Farcaster was another hurdle. Ensuring real-time updates and synchronization between the game and the leaderboard required a robust database management system.
3. **Creating API and Game Logic**: Designing and implementing the API for **BasedJack** and coding the game logic posed both fun and challenging aspects of development. It involved crafting efficient algorithms and ensuring smooth gameplay mechanics.

## Technologies Used
